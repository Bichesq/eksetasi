# CD Pipeline Startup Failure - Fixes Applied

## üîß Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Working Directory Problem** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: The GitHub Actions workflows were running from the repository root, but your project files are in the `mcq-exam-system` subdirectory.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `WORKING_DIRECTORY: 'mcq-exam-system'` environment variable
- Added `defaults.run.working-directory` to all jobs
- Updated `cache-dependency-path` to point to the correct package-lock.json location

### 2. **Environment Setup** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Missing `.env` file creation during build process.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "Setup environment" step that creates `.env` file with required variables
- Ensures both environment variables and .env file are available during build

### 3. **Vercel Action Configuration** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Vercel action needed proper working directory configuration.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `working-directory` parameter to Vercel deployment steps
- Kept using `amondnet/vercel-action@v25` (stable version)

### 4. **Health Check URLs** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Health check was trying to access undefined URL secrets.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added conditional checks for URL availability
- Graceful handling when URLs are not configured
- Clear messaging for missing configurations

## üìã Required GitHub Secrets

Make sure you have these secrets configured in your GitHub repository:

### Staging Environment
- `STAGING_DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string for staging
- `STAGING_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for staging
- `STAGING_URL` - Your staging deployment URL (optional, for health checks)

### Production Environment  
- `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string for production
- `PRODUCTION_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for production
- `PRODUCTION_URL` - Your production deployment URL (optional, for health checks)

### Vercel Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel deployment token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Your Vercel project ID

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. **Test the Fixed Pipeline**
```bash
# Commit and push the changes
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Fix CD pipeline working directory and environment setup"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Monitor the Workflow**
- Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
- Watch the CI/CD pipeline execution
- Check for any remaining issues

### 3. **Verify Secrets Configuration**
- Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
- Ensure all required secrets are properly set
- Check for typos or extra spaces in secret values

### 4. **Test Deployment**
- The staging deployment should trigger automatically on push to main
- Production deployment requires creating a tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the pipeline still fails:

1. **Check the logs** in GitHub Actions for specific error messages
2. **Verify working directory** - all commands should run from `mcq-exam-system/`
3. **Test locally** to ensure build works:
   ```bash
   cd mcq-exam-system
   npm ci
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   npm run build
   ```

### Common Issues:
- **Database connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL format and accessibility
- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure package-lock.json is committed
- **Build failures**: Check for TypeScript or linting errors
- **Vercel deployment**: Verify Vercel tokens and project configuration

## üìù Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - Fixed working directory and environment setup
2. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Fixed working directory for consistency

### Key Improvements:
- ‚úÖ Proper working directory configuration
- ‚úÖ Environment file creation during build
- ‚úÖ Better error handling for health checks
- ‚úÖ Consistent configuration across CI/CD pipelines
- ‚úÖ Clear logging and status messages

The pipeline should now work correctly with your project structure!
